### Social Issues in Computing

#### Who Owns the Internet?

No one really owns the internet. 

#### Net Neutrality

* Should Internet providers have the right to slow certain kinds of web traffic?
* Should Internet providers have the right to deny access to certain websites?

#### Access to the Internet

* Internet access is assumed to be available to everyone, but it is not
* The poor, and thus often people of color and first nations populations, often have less access to internet. 

#### Access to Computer Science

* The ability to program a computer changes the kind of problems you solve.
    * You don't have to wait for someone to build the program you want to use - you can do it yourself!
* But programming is not taught to all grade school students
    * BC has taken steps to change that
* Again, the poor have limited access to these programs

#### Privacy

* Your data says a lot about you
* Who owns your data?
* Why should you care?
    * Perhaps you can be manipulated by those who have access to your data

#### Facebook Likes 

* Can determine a lot about you. 

Ads can be micro-targeted

* So what? My Facebook likes are private
    * Many apps and online quizzes today require access to private data as a precondition for taking personality tests
* Privacy protection is vital for some groups
    * Religious groups
    * Victims of domestic abuse
    * Whistle blowers

#### Bias in Machine Learning

* Garbage in, Garbage out
* Bias in, Bias out

Model of word meaning

* Process a large dataset of text gathered from the internet.
* How we use words gives us hints about word meaning.
* Use statistics about how words are used to infer word meaning.

Word Analogy tasks

* These word usage models are really effective at some work meaning tasks
* Man is to king as woman is to?
    * queen 
* Man is to programmer as woman is to?
    * homemaker

The model is racist

* If we build a word model just using tweets from alt-right twitter accounts.

What does it mean?
