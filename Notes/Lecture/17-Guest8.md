Prodominant Modelling Paradigm: 

* Triangle Mesh
* GPU
* Scanning = Model Acquisition 

Solid Modelling: 

* Contructive solid geometry
* Implicit modelling

#### Solid modelling / Implicit modelling

* Modelling for computer graphics
* Curisosity driven research

Important Dates:

* Ricci 1973
* Blinn 1981
* Nishimura 1985
* Wyvills 1985

Modeling: 

* Implicit surfaces
* Contours (several)
* Functions

**Proximity Blending:** add contributions from generating skeletal elements in the neighboouhood.

**The blobtree:** skeletal primitives.
resulting shapes.

#### The great train rubbery 1986/88

**Wraping:** example vector warp

Barr operators:

* Twist
* Taper
* Bend

Deformations

CSG intersection value

CsoftG wheels 1997

#### Canmore Coffee Grinder
Ray traced by kees van overveld and brian wyvill

#### Original Teapot Render.

l-system plant (generating branch structures)

The blobtree 1996

Precise contact modelling controlled blending and PCM

Collars and scars -> visualize tree growth

Inverse modelling

Sketch based modelling with the blobtree

Shape Shop - Ryan 

* Sketch based interactive modelling

Improvement

A single oriented implicit decal

Matisse

Decals spans all surfaces

#### Is uni modelling research dead?

* Geologist
* SIGGRAPH

**Beware of knowing the price of everything an the value of nothing!**
