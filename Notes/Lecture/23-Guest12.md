    * Requirements Engineering: Collaboration, Process Improvement and Runtime Self-adaptivity
    * Awareness tools for distributed coordination
* Expertise
    * Empirical studies of developers
    * Data mining of large software repositories
    * Social network analysis
* Industrial partnerships

#### Distrubuted communication and Delay

Does distance imply delay?

* Delay in communication and issue resolution
* Communication: Response time on issue communication

Repo -> Communication / Issue

Delay in Communication -> Response Time

#### Discovering Requirements at Runtime in Unpredictable Environments

Worked with a team of 4 rowers Crossing the Atlantic OceanDeveloped data mining techniques to discover patterns in usage and context

Rowers --> 4hours interval 

They required a scheduler to tell them what to do.
