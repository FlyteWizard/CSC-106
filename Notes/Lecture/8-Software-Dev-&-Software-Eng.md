### Software Development and Software Engineering

#### Why does it matter?

* Software is being integrated into everythnig we own
    * coffee makers
    * refrigerators
    * cars
    * airplanes 

#### The high cost of software bugs

* "The cost to fix an error found a#er product release was four to five Gmes as much as one uncovered during design, and up to 100 Gmes more than one idenGfied in the maintenance phase."
    * If a bug is found in the requirements-gathering phase, the cost could be $100.
    * If the product owner doesn't

* A 2003 study commisioned by the Department of Commerce's National Institure of Standards and Technology found that software bugs cost the US economy $59.5 billion annually. 
    * AND that was almost 15 years ago!

#### Software Bugs

* NASA Mars Polar Lander
* Spacecrart Mars Climate Orbiter
* NASA Mariner 1
* FORTRAN Software
* Therac-25
* Knight Capital Group
* Bank of Queensland

#### What is software?

* Source Code, Executables and Documentation
* It's invisible/intagible
* Conceptual Complexity
* "Softness"

#### Desired qualities of software?

* Correctness
* Reliability
* Safety
* Usability
* Efficiency
* Interoperability
* Maintainability
* Portability
* Customizability
* Extensibility
* Reusability
* Others?

#### What is software engineering?

* Software Engineering is...
    * Discipline that applies theories, methods, and tools to solve problems related to software production and maintance
    *  Software engineers strive to deliver high- quality software that satisfies users’ needs, on time and within budget

**Why is software engineering an important discipline?**

**What are some of the main challenges in developing software?**

#### Laws of evolution...

* Software that remains useful over time, will
    * continually **change**...
    * become more **complex**
    * increase in **size**
    * decrease in **quality**

**Free Puppy = Free Software**

#### History of Software Engineering

* Term coined in 1968 due to **The Software Crisis!**
    * "The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.” Edsger Dijkstra, 1972
* Still debated a bit what the term "software engineering" means!

#### No Silver Bullet

* "there is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude [tenfold] improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.“ Fred Brooks, 1986

* Difference between **essential complexity**

#### Fred Books

* Brook's Law: "**adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.**"
* Watch for the "**second system effect.**"
* The tendency towards irreductible number of **errors**
* Question: 
    * How does a large sofware project get to be one year late?
    * One day at a time!
* Always design a system to **throw away**
* **"good" programmer** are generally five to ten times as productive as mediocre ones.

#### Software process (1)

* A software process is a set of activities are:
    * Specifications:
        * Defines what the software should do, and its operational constraints
    * Design and Implementation:
        * Designs the solutions, and produces the source code to meet the specification 
    * Validation:
        * Checks that the software produced is what the customer wants
    * Evolution: 
        * Changes made to the software that meet user's changing needs


**More fin grained steps**

#### Why follow a given process?

* Repeatability
* Manageability
* Measurability

* Interim work products 
* Activities are less likely to be forgotten

#### What kind of process...

#### Agile development and extreme programming

* Approach to software development that is: humanistic and lightweight
* Relies heavily on feedback and communication

**Characteristics:**

* Pair programming
* Test-first design
* Refactoring
* Continous integration
* Collective ownership
* Coding standards
* 40 hour week
* Customer on team

#### Continuous Integration

* Every progremmas has their own version of the code, which they work on on their own computer.
* Changes are synchronized with a version control program like git
* Programmers integrate code changes often, even several times a day

* Communication is facilitated through:
    * source code
    * test cases
    * system structure
    * use case scenarios
    * task estimation

* Pair Programming:
    * Two programmers work together at one computer
        * Driver
            * strategize over direction 
            * think of improvements
            * see likely future problems to address
            * bigger picture
        * Observer/Navigator
            * actually wrtires the code
            * more details oriented
        * Switch roles often to prevent fatigue, leep interest
        * More man power BUT less code defects
        * Great learning experience
        * Better for complex task

* Software Testing:
    * Every line of code is tested (in practice, impossible)
    * Test -> while coding, before coding

* Ethics...
    * ACM/IEEE Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice
    * Eight Priniciples

Ethical Dilemmas?

* Your employers acts unethical
* You participate in the development of military weapons or nuclear systems
* Produce Malware
* Others?

Open Source:

* Sort of like a bazaar (Production Code like a cathedral)

Things to think about:

* How is software engineering different from other kinds of engineering (e.g. civil, mechanical, electrical etc)?
* How is software engineering different from computer science? 

Summary

* Software engineering is an exciting field!
* Combines elements of engineering, computer science, social sciences, business, management....
* Can be interdisciplinary
* Is an important profession! Software engineers are in high demand!
