### Programming Languages

#### What is programming: 

* SQL:

`select * from books` 

* HTML:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello World</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
* Prolog:

```prolog
playsAirGuitar(jody). 

?-  playsAirGuitar(jody).
```

#### Are some programming languages better than others?

* [ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC/wiki/ArnoldC)
    * Based on Arnold quotes

#### Two Criteria: 

1. Can our language allow us to program the computer to do anything our computer can do?
2. Can ou computer do anything that our program can express?

#### Turing Machine

* Entscheidungsproblem
    * Does there exist an algorithm for deciding wether or not a specific mathematical assertion does or does not have a proof?
* Church-Turing Thesis
    * A function on the natural numbers is computable in an informal sense if and only if it is computable...
* Lambda-Calculus = Turing Machine = Pencil and Paper

#### Turing Complete

* A programming language that can used to simulate a turing machine
* Any turing machine can be simulated with a program in such language
* Any program in such language can be converted to a turing machine
    
#### BrainFuck

* http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/
* Language is Turing Complete

Therefore not all TC languages are very useful.
    
#### What is a good programming language?

**Answer:** The one that gets you a job?
    
#### How to learn how to program

**Answer:** Not in your CS courses!

"Quote" - Alan Perlis

#### The five features you must learn

- The Syntax
- The Semantics
- The Libraries
- The Idioms
- The Tools

**Additional Reading:** What makes a great software engineer? By Oaul Luo Li, Andrew J. Ko, and Jiamin Zhu

#### Skills of a good programmer

- Curious 
- Hardworking

#### My recommendations?

* Be great at
    * one programming language
* Be good at
    * one statically typed language
    * one dynamincally type language
    * one functional language
* Master:
    * Typing
    * Debugging
    * One Programming Environment
    * Version Control
    * A Configuration Management Tool [(cmake)](https://cmake.org/)
    * Testing

* **Select your jobs carefully**
* **Do side-projects**
* **And keep learning**
