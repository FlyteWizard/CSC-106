### Sorting

* Often useful to have data sorted 
    * find values more quickly
    * test for existence more quickly
* Many algorithms for sorting

### Arrays

Arrays are like a list

Start numbering positions at 0

Square brackets []

Assign a value to an array

**Left side changes**

Selection Sort

Sort hand of cadrs ?

Numerically


Ex. 

[2,8,6,3]

Unsorted part of the list and sorted part of the list.



Input integer array my_nums

    Keep track of sorted array section 
    Search through unsorted array for max val
    Swap max val with element at the rightmmost position of unsorted section
    Move sorted section one element to left
    stop when unsorted section has size 1
